# Active-Learning
A semi-supervised Natural Langage Processing Algorithm that uses the Active Learning method to speed-up the learning rate by choosing the relevent samples to label in order to retrain the model.

The algorithm uses two classifiers : Naive Bayes and SVM. 
It was tested on two different datasets : the ng5 package and a kaggle downloaded one.

The Algorithm tries to predict the category (theme) of a given santence.
